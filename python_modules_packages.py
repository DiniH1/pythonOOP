# Python's extensive documentation on python.org
#  We have used funcs that we created as well as built in

import math # to calcuate values
from random import random # to generate random numbers


num1 = 23.44

# in real life situations you have to round the figure depending on the value
#  if the value is less than .50 round down to 23 if 23.51 then round it up

print(math.ceil(num1))
print(math.floor(num1))

# Random class/methods
print(random())
# generates a random number everytime the prorams executes between 0.0 to .99
print(math.pi)
